#+TITLE: xref-relative-locations.el

This package provides a global minor mode to make location filenames
relative in Xref buffers.

This can be useful if your source of Xref locations in a project (tags
tables, shell commands, etc.) provides absolute location filenames only,
and your project lives in a somewhat deeply nested directory structure:
by hiding the base directory part of filenames, the remaining relative
part becomes succinct and more meaningful in your current context.

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =xref-relative-locations.el=,
put it in your =load-path= and =require= it. Finally, use
=(xref-relative-locations-mode 1)= or =M-x xref-relative-locations-mode=
to turn on the provided minor mode.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package xref-relative-locations
  :ensure t
  :config
  (xref-relative-locations-mode 1))
#+end_src

* Screenshots

* Notes

Note that pre-existing Xref buffers are not affected by toggling the
minor mode on or off.

Also note that the Xref buffer content does not actually change as other
functionality might rely on absolute paths: rather, the base directory
part in location filenames is hidden using text overlays.
